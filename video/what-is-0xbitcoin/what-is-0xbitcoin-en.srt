1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,996
0xBitcoin is the first fully decentralized ERC20 token

2
00:00:04,997 --> 00:00:08,010
and is the first purely mined token on Ethereum

3
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:11,047
and it aims to be the primary medium of exchange

4
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:13,609
and store of value on the Ethereum network.

5
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:17,706
The 0xBitcoin token was deployed to the Ethereum blockchain in

6
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:21,211
February 2018 with the following attributes:

7
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:22,919
first mineable token,

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,911
ERC20 compatible,

9
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:26,927
no pre-mine or instamine,

10
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,528
and no ICO.

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,606
Ether was never intended to act as a currency, and

12
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:35,964
0xBitcoin will allow Ether to fulfill its sole intended purpose

13
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,129
of securing the Ethereum network.

14
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,339
0xBitcoin takes the best properties of Bitcoin and Ethereum

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,717
and combines them into one token.

16
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:47,059
It can be mined exactly like Bitcoin

17
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:51,008
but transferred 10 times faster and 100 times cheaper.

18
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:54,169
0xBitcoin combines the Bitcoin properties of

19
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,193
block rewards, proof-of-work issuance,

20
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:59,185
and a 21 million coin cap

21
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:00,887
with the Ethereum properties of

22
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:04,451
speed, DApps, and DEX trading.

23
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:07,742
And unlike Ether, it interfaces with smart contracts

24
00:01:07,743 --> 00:01:09,878
for storing and transferring value.

25
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:13,693
While Bitcoin can only be traded using centralized means,

26
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:16,685
0xBitcoin can be traded permissionlessly via

27
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:19,999
smart contracts which cannot be affected or controlled

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,386
by central entities.

29
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:24,710
It is also immune to 51% attacks.

30
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:27,293
Add all this to the proven market demand for a

31
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,586
faster version of Bitcoin, as we've seen in

32
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:32,091
Litecoin's success, and it is plain that

33
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,928
0xBitcoin fills a hole in the crypto market space.

34
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:39,402
People are excited about the project in no small part due to

35
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:41,514
the decentralization of the token

36
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:43,931
and the active and engaged community

37
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:46,106
which has sprung up around the token.

38
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:48,710
The community has achieved several key milestones

39
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:51,262
since the project's launch, including

40
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,865
creating an EIP specifically for mineable tokens,

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,530
creation of mining pools with multiple new mining clients,

42
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,755
as well as ongoing development of Lava Wallet,

43
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:04,370
Quarry, and off-chain transactions.

44
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,677
0xBitcoin is a unique project, backed by a passionate community

45
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,949
dedicated to making it the primary transfer of value

46
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,714
for the Ethereum network.
